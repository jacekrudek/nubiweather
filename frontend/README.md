# Frontend
## React
## Svelte
## Vue

In this directory you'll find frontend startes for different frontend frameworks. Each starter is preconfigured with Vite and TailwindCSS. Depending on your preference, you can choose between Angular, React, Svelte or Vue and JavaScript or TypeScript versions.

## What we expect from you?

Build simple web application that uses https://www.weatherapi.com/ to show current weather in 2 cities: Gliwice and Hamburg. The application can be built using any technology you like. 
Functionality that we expect:
1. Display current weather in Gliwice and Hamburg
2. Display forecast for next days in Gliwice and Hamburg

Those are basic requirements, but feel free to add more features if you like, however don't spend too much time on it - max 8 hours.

## Guidelines for frontend:

1. Clean and readable code
2. Responsive design
3. Usage of modern frontend technologies
4. Usage of best practices (don't get too fancy, we're looking for clean and readable code)
5. Usage of version control system (git)
6. Usage of provided API (we want to see how you use it)
7. Instructions on how to run the application (we want to see your application in action)
8. Readme with basic information about the application and features you've implemented
+ 9. Bonus points for hosting the application on github pages or similar (we don't expect you to pay for hosting) [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site]
